# TCP Supplier

This module provides a TCP supplier that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` uses the `TcpReceivingChannelAdapter` from Spring Integration.
A `tcpSupplier` bean is implemented as a `java.util.function.Supplier`.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream from TCP sources.
The supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and then receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `TcpSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean: `tcpSupplier`.

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `tcpSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `tcp.supplier` and `tcp`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/tcp/TcpSupplierProperties.java[TcpSupplierProperties].
In addition to this, there is also link:../../common/tcp-common/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/common/tcp/TcpConnectionFactoryProperties.java[this set of properties] to consider.

## Tests

See this link:src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/tcp[test suite] for the various ways, this supplier is used.

## Other usage

See this https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/applications/source/tcp-source/README.adoc[README] where this supplier is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream application where it makes an TCP Source.
