# Time Supplier

This module provides a Time supplier that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` uses the `FastDateFormat` from Apache Commons library.
`timeSupplier` is implemented as a `java.util.function.Supplier`.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `TimeSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`timeSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<String>`.

You can use `timeSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `time`.
